This repository contains a collection of coding problems solved on various platforms, like LeetCode, organized by difficulty or type. Each solution is implemented in Python and includes a breakdown of the time complexity and space complexity. The goal of this repository is to document problem-solving techniques, data structures, and algorithms while providing insights into the performance of each approach.

___Leetcode___ 

The ```./leetcode/``` directory is structured into categories such as "Easy," "Medium," and "Hard" for ease of navigation, with future expansions for more types of challenges. For each problem, youâ€™ll find a detailed solution along with its associated time and space complexities, parsed directly from the solution file.
